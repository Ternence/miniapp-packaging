        <p>This specification defines semantics and conformance requirements for a [=MiniApp Package=], and the structure of the single file container that holds the resources of a MiniApp, including a [=manifest=] file, static page templates, stylesheets, JavaScript documents, media files and other resources. Instances of the [=MiniApp Package=] are used for MiniApp distribution and execution on runtime environments ([=MiniApp User Agent=]).</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>MiniApp is a concept of light software application, that can be distributed through any digital means, and accessed through the Web. MiniApps are defined by a concrete file structure and all the resources are comprised within a single file that represents the whole MiniApp package that can be distributed and executed by [=MiniApp User Agents=].</p>
            <p>A [=MiniApp Package=] contains a directory structure that holds the specific resources of the MiniApp that defines the rendering, operation, and interaction with the end-users — including static page templates, stylesheets, JavaScript documents, media files, and other resources — and the MiniApp Manifest. The MiniApp Manifest, located in the central directory of the package, describes the MiniApp, including information about page routing, styles, and other operational and rendering details of the MiniApp, as well as descriptive information for humans.</p>
            <p>As defined in the signature section, MiniApps MAY support digital signature verification to guarantee the integrity of the package and contents during the delivery of the package.</p>
            <p>The MiniApp runtime environment ([=MiniApp User Agent=]) identifies MiniApp package files through the standard package format and the specific MIME media type. After fetching the MiniApp package file, the [=MiniApp User Agent=] loads the static page templates, CSS, JavaScript files, and other resources into the cache, following a dereference step. These MiniApp resources will remain available in the cache until the next update, avoiding unnecessary network fetches.</p>
            <p>In terms of launch mode, the MiniApp can be launched normally when offline. The [=MiniApp User Agent=] locates the specified startup page from the package cache path and launches the MiniApp according to the description of the [=manifest=] file.</p>

            <h3>Terminology</h3>
            <p>The following terms are specific to MiniApps.</p>

                <dd>
                    <p>A cryptographic mechanism and hashing techniques to prove the authenticity of [=resources=]. Digital signatures can demonstrate the origin, time, identity, and status of [=resources=] and of the [=MiniApp Package=].</p>
                    <p>The usual scenario of MiniApps may involve two kinds of signatures: application developer signature, which gives a recipient strong reason to believe that this package was created by a known sender (authentication) and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity); and distributors’ signatures (for example, official marketplace signatures), which are used to ensure that the application permission is officially authorized, release channels and devices are authorized.</p>

                |       |___en-US.json
            </pre>
            <section>
                <h3>Root Directory</h3>
                <p>The [=Root Directory=] of a [=MiniApp Package=] holds several reserved files that include global data and information about the lifecycle management of the MiniApp, including:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt><code>manifest.json</code></dt>
                    <dd>The [=MiniApp Manifest=] is a JSON document responsible for the global configuration of the MiniApp. A manifest file contains a collection of mandatory and optional attributes that indicate the setup of the MiniApp, including routes and paths of the pages and the window configuration of the MiniApp (e.g., styles of the navigation bar, background image and color, page title, among other), according to the MiniApp Manifest [[MINIAPP_MANIFEST]] specification.</dd>
                    <dt><code>app.css</code></dt>
                    <dd>This file is the default CSS stylesheet, responsible for the global appearance of the [=MiniApp pages=].</dd>
                    <dt><code>app.js</code></dt>
                    <dd>This script document has the basic service logic of the MiniApp and includes the basic control of the MiniApp lifecycle, including the management of events for launch, showing and hiding the  MiniApp.</dd>

            </section>
            <section>
                <h3><code>pages</code> Directory</h3>
                <p>The <code>pages</code> directory contains a set of files for the display and user interaction of the [=MiniApp Pages=]. Each set of files that shares the same base file name (e.g. 'page1') with different extension names describe a particular page on different aspects, such as the service logic (e.g. page1.js), the configuration (e.g. page1.json), the structure (e.g. page1.xml) and the style (e.g page1.css). Developers can choose to put all page files directly under the <code>pages</code> directory in a flat manner or organize them in different sub-directories for different pages.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A <code>.json</code> file is responsible for the configuration of a MiniApp page. The syntax and structure of these type of files are defined in the <a href="#sec-miniapp-resources-json">JSON Resources</a> section.</li>
                    <li>A <code>.xml</code> file is responsible for the structure of a MiniApp page, similar to HTML. The syntax and structure of these type of files are defined in the <a href="#sec-miniapp-resources-xml">XML Resources</a> section.</li>
                    <li>A <code>.css</code> file is responsible for the CSS style of a MiniApp page. The syntax and structure of these type of files are defined in the <a href="#sec-miniapp-resources-css">CSS Resources</a> section.</li>
                    <li>A <code>.js</code> file is responsible for the service logic and lifecycle management (defined in MiniApp Lifecycle [[MINIAPP_LIFECYCLE]]) of a MiniApp page. The syntax and structure of these type of files are defined in the <a href="#sec-miniapp-resources-js">JS Resources</a> section.</li>

            <section>
                <h3><code>common</code> Directory</h3>
                <p>The <code>common</code> directory contains resources such as components, multimedia resources, and libraries that are accessible from all [=MiniApp Pages=] in a MiniApp. The internal structure of this directory is flexible, so these common resources MAY be organized in customized subdirectories, and using different name conventions, as needed.</p>
            </section>

                <h3><code>i18n</code> Directory</h3>
                <p>The <code>i18n</code> directory contains multi-language configuration files to support the internationalization of the MiniApp. The file name of each <code>.json</code> document in this directory follows the <code>Language-Tag</code> notation as defined in [[BCP47]], and represents the specific configuration for that particular language.</p>
                <p class="ednote" title="Still to define the format">
                        The detailed format of the <code>.json </code> file is to be further developed.

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>A [=MiniApp ZIP Container=] is a physical single-file representation of a MiniApp that can be used to distribute it in different scenarios, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An organization that stores and lists catalogs of MiniApps (i.e., marketplace);</li>
                <li>A developer that builds a MiniApp and delivers it to a marketplace;</li>
                <li>A developer that shares a MiniApp with the <abbr title="Quality Assurance">QA</abbr> department for testing.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="sec-miniapp-zip-file-requirements">
            <h3>ZIP File Requirements</h3>
            <p>A [=MiniApp ZIP Container=] uses the ZIP format [[ZIP]], including some particularities:</p>
        	<ul class="conformance-list">
                <li>The contents of the [=MiniApp ZIP Container=] MUST be a conforming [=MiniApp Package=].</li>
                <li>MiniApp ZIP Containers MUST NOT use the ZIP encryption mechanisms.</li>                
                <li>MiniApp ZIP Containers MUST NOT use the features in the ZIP application note [[ZIP]] that allow ZIP files to be spanned across multiple storage media, or split into multiple files.</li>
                <li>MiniApp ZIP Containers MUST include ZIP uncompressed and Deflate-compressed (lossless data compression) contents within the ZIP archive.</li>
                <li>MiniApp ZIP Containers MUST use UTF-8 [[Unicode]] for encoding filenames.</li>
                <li>MiniApp ZIP Containers MUST NOT use patented features.</li>
                <li>MiniApp ZIP Containers MAY include a special block, the [=MiniApp Signing Block=], to allow digital signatures affecting the whole package.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The structure of a MiniApp ZIP Container is as follows:</p>
            <pre>
    [ZIP File Entries]
    [MiniApp Signing Block]    
    [ZIP Central Directory]
    [End of ZIP Central Directory]</pre>

                <img src="images/signature_zip_summary.svg" alt="Structure of standard ZIP package and the MiniApp package with a signing block in the middle" />
                <figcaption>ZIP package and MiniApp package with an optional signing block</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The [=MiniApp ZIP Container=] is parsed by first finding the start of the ZIP Central Directory (locating the ZIP End of Central Directory record at the end of the file, then reading the start offset of the Central Directory from the record). Every MiniApp Signing Block MAY include a [=Signing Block Magic Numbers=] block, as specified in <a href="#sec-miniapp-digital-signature-requirements">Digital Signature Requirements</a>, to identify the presence of digital signatures. Once the "magic numbers" block is recognized, the [=MiniApp Processor=] would be able to process the digital signatures stored in the Signing Block, in the immediately preceding section of the Central Directory, as shown in <a href="#figure-package-references"></a>.</p>

            <p>MiniApps vendors MAY adopt the digital signature schemes depending on their needs.</p>  
            <p class="ednote" title="To add extension">
                MiniApp files MAY be identified by the .ma file extension although the use of a file extension is not required.

            <h3>Digital Signature Requirements</h3>  
            <p>A [=MiniApp ZIP Container=] MAY include none, one, or more [=signatures=] to help to detect any changes to the protected parts of the software, guaranteeing the integrity of the MiniApp.</p>
            <p>A <dfn id="dfn-signing_block" data-lt="Signing Block|MiniApp Signing Block|MiniApp Signing Blocks" data-dfn-type="dfn">MiniApp Signing Block</dfn> is a collection of bytes that contains specific information and metadata about the digital signature that affects a MiniApp, partially or as a whole. The [=Signing Block=] of a [=MiniApp ZIP Container=] MUST be located immediately before the central directory of the ZIP container, in a way that makes it easier to locate the block if exists.</p>
            <p>Although this document does not recommend any specific digital signature mechanism (i.e., hash algorithms, encryption methods, etc.), the [=Signing Block=], if present, MUST meet the following criteria:</p>
        	<dl class="conformance-list">
                <dt>Signing Block Magic numbers</dt>
                <dd>A 16-byte block that provides a quick way to identify the Signing Block as the preceding block of the Central Directory. This "magic numbers" byte sequence univocally identifies the type of digital signature included in the Signing Block.</li>

        <h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Package Integrity and Trustworthiness</h3>
            <p>To ensure the integrity and trustworthiness within the distribution stage of MiniApps, a [=MiniApp Package=] SHOULD be protected by one or more [=Digital Signatures=]. These signatures, along with certificates issued by trusted authorities, could help third parties to validate the authorship of the MiniApp (e.g. the MiniApp developer), and other entities involved in the development or distribution of the software (e.g., an application store as MiniApp distributor).</p>
            <p>The usual scenarios where digital signatures are included in MiniApps are, but not limited to:</p> 
            <ul>  
                <li>A digital signature (with a valid certificate) of the author that ensures the origin of the MiniApp. Thus, an end-user or a hosting platform can decide whether to install the [=MiniApp Package=] depending on the status and quality of the author (e.g., credits, blocklist, certifications, etc.).</li>
                <li>A digital signature (with a valid certificate) of the distributor guarantees the integrity of the package and, subsequently the trustworthiness of the delivery channel. This kind of signature protects end-users from tampering activities and ensures a healthy ecosystem of applications. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>No specific digital signature mechanism, cryptographic technology, or algorithm is recommended in this specification. MiniApp vendors MAY or MAY NOT implement digital signature mechanisms, according to their use cases, always following the [=MiniApp Package=] requirements.</p>

            <P>Any MiniApp may have different digital signatures, using different methods, as represented in the <a href="#figure-miniapp-signatures-example"></a>.</P>

                <figcaption>Example of different signature methods included in the MiniApp package</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p class="note">Some examples of technologies and encryption methods are introduced in the <a href="#sec-signature-schemes"></a>.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Content Confidentiality</h3>
            <p>This specification does not recommend any encryption mechanism for the MiniApp package to protect its confidentiality. However, it doesn't preclude an implementation from deploying some encryption mechanism for special purposes.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>IANA Considerations</h2>
        <p>
            The proposed MIME type for the MiniApp package is <code>application/miniapp-pkg+zip</code> following <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6839#section-3.6">the +zip Structured Syntax Suffix</a> defined in [[RFC6839]]. It needs to be registered with <a href="https://www.iana.org/">IANA</a> when this work moves to a normative phase. There is no specific fragment identifier consideration for now.
        <p class="note">
            <span>Note:</span>
            A temporary solution could be <code>application/x-w3c-miniapp-pkg+zip</code> for the sake of any early implementation.
